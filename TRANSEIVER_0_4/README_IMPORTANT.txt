Here in version 4 when I wanted to add more effective features
A road block was met due to how complex it was getting without having an
Object oriented model of the transceiver therefore that needs to be made before going 
further, in the mean time NRF_GUI_APP_03 is in here to text anything new on the way
We need this object oriented feature without tediously having to check the address manually
So ironically at this point we need to back track to a command line program using the transceivers
